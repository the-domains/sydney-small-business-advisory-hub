**_Employee Share Schemes and Start Up Businesses_!**

Do you know the changes made to employee share schemes from July 1, 2015 and how they benefit your business?

Employee share schemes (ESS) provide an opportunity for employees to receive shares (or options to buy shares) in the company they work for.

There have been changes to the tax rules for employee share schemes to make it more attractive to employers and employees to participate, including a new concession for start-up companies.

**Changes to employee share schemes**

The changes include:

* when options are taxed
* increasing the maximum ownership limit to 10% of the total shares (up from 5%)
* increasing the deferral period to 15 years (up from seven years) for tax deferred schemes.

**Additional concessions for start-up companies**

Under the new rules if shares are acquired in a start-up at a discount of up to 15% (relative to market value), then the discount is exempt from income tax. The shares will only be subject to capital gains tax on disposal.

**What is a start-up?**

Start-up companies, from any industry, need to:

* be incorporated for less than 10 years
* be an Australian resident company
* have no equity interests listed on an approved stock exchange
* have an aggregated turnover less than $50 million.

**So what do I need to know and where do I go?**
